##  Data Portal

The [data portal](https://dades.biogenoma.cat/) collates the INSDC metadata with other metadata defined within the CBP, such as photos, vernacular names, custom metadata, publications and genome annotations.

- If you have any image of the collected species that you want to put in the data portal. First publish this image into Zenodo, Wikimedia or any other public images database, then provide the link to <a href="mailto:emilio.righi@crg.eu">Emilio Righi</a>
- Any other relevant information of the collected species can also be provided, catalan name, etc (Note that this are the species metadata and not the sample metadata)
- The portal has also a genome browser where the genome annotation of the sequences species can be visualized, but it is first necessary to publish the genome assembly, chromosome level, to INSDC. If this is your case you can provide <a href="mailto:emilio.righi@crg.eu">Emilio Righi</a> with genome annotation files in the following formats: the gzipped gff (gff.gz) and the tabindexed gzipped gff (gff.gz.tbi)
