##  GoaT Report

[GoaT](https://goat.genomehubs.org/) is the official sequencing status tracker of the Earth Biogenome Project.
From the CBP we generate a [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v07sLdzDiWF5Pge4hYUd67wQ-dXTWK7EMRTp0i0vlD8/edit#heading=h.r98o47b47e3u) that updates GoaT, thus the EBP, with our sequencing progresses.
The report is generated from the [portal](https://dades.biogenoma.cat/status) and <a href="mailto:emilio.righi@crg.eu">Emilio Righi</a> is in charge of it.

Since March 2023, users are responsible to update their data in the CBP portal. Contact <a href="mailto:emilio.righi@crg.eu">Emilio Righi</a> and he will create a user for you. In case your species is already present in the portal, report also the species name in the email, in this way you will be granted permissions to modify it.

**Update the sequencing status of the species when:**

- the sequencing data of the species are not yet submitted to INSDC or are submitted but with an embargo (they are not public yet)
- a paper related to the sequenced species is published
- the sequencing status of the species changes, for instance the DNA has been sequenced etc.

The portal will retrieve all the data published to INSDC under the CBP umbrella, this means that it is not necessary to update Emilio if the data are already public, the process is automatized!

For more info about the sequencing status take a look at this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v07sLdzDiWF5Pge4hYUd67wQ-dXTWK7EMRTp0i0vlD8/edit#heading=h.r98o47b47e3u)

##  Data Portal

The [data portal](https://dades.biogenoma.cat/) collates the INSDC metadata with other metadata defined within the CBP, such as photos, vernacular names, custom metadata, publications and genome annotations.

- If you have any image of the collected species that you want to put in the data portal. First publish this image into Zenodo, Wikimedia or any other public images database, then provide the link to <a href="mailto:emilio.righi@crg.eu">Emilio Righi</a>
- Any other relevant information of the collected species can also be provided, catalan name, etc (Note that this are the species metadata and not the sample metadata)
- The portal has also a genome browser where the genome annotation of the sequences species can be visualized, but it is first necessary to publish the genome assembly, chromosome level, to INSDC. If this is your case you can provide <a href="mailto:emilio.righi@crg.eu">Emilio Righi</a> with genome annotation files in the following formats: the gzipped gff (gff.gz) and the tabindexed gzipped gff (gff.gz.tbi)
